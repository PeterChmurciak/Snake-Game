# SnakeGame

A simple console snake game for Windows OS inspired by youtube user NVitanovic (www.youtube.com/user/NVitanovic).

Purpose of this project is to get better understanding of Git and GitHub features. 

## How to play

You will have to compile the C++ code to play the game. The easiest way to do that is to open the `Snake.cpp` file in your preffered IDE, for example [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), and press `Build and run` (or F9) button on the toolbar.
